## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.99] - 2026-05-28

Terminal relocation release on the legacy `org.javai` coordinates.

The published POM contains a Maven `<relocation>` directive pointing
at `org.mavai:outcome:1.0.0-alpha1`. Maven and Gradle honour this
automatically: consumers resolving `org.javai:outcome:0.3.99` are
redirected to `org.mavai:outcome:1.0.0-alpha1` with a deprecation
warning.

No further releases will be published under `org.javai`. Consumers
should update their dependency coordinates explicitly to
`org.mavai:outcome:1.0.0-alpha1` or later; the relocation POM is a
safety net for unmaintained consumers.

The jar / sources / javadoc artifacts in this release are the
functional `0.3.x` code under `org.javai.outcome.*`; consumers who
explicitly pin this GAV (bypassing relocation resolution) get a
working library, not an empty placeholder.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **`module-info.java`** — the library now ships a real JPMS module
  descriptor. The module name is `org.javai.outcome`; every public
  package is exported (`org.javai.outcome`, `.boundary`, `.ops`,
  `.ops.log4j`, `.ops.metrics`, `.ops.slack`, `.ops.teams`,
  `.retry`). Requires `java.net.http`, `java.sql`, and
  `static org.slf4j`. Modular consumers can now depend on the
  published artifact directly via `requires org.javai.outcome`
  without the `extra-java-module-info` shim previously needed.

### Consumer impact
- **Classpath consumers** — no change. The descriptor is invisible
  to non-modular builds.
- **Modular consumers** — add `requires org.javai.outcome` to their
  own `module-info.java`. Sibling projects that previously wrapped
  outcome as an automatic module (notably `punit-core`'s
  `extraJavaModuleInfo { automaticModule("org.javai:outcome",
  "outcome") }` block) can drop the shim once they upgrade to
  0.3.0; the module is now named `org.javai.outcome`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- `Failure` record fields `exception`, `retryAfter`, and `correlationId` now use `Optional` instead of nullable types
- `RetryPolicy` implementations now respect the failure's `retryAfter` hint via a shared `withDelayStrategy` method, removing duplication between `fixed` and `backoff` policies

### Added
- `HttpStatusException` — checked exception carrying HTTP status code and parsed `Retry-After` hint
- `HttpResponses.requireSuccess(HttpResponse)` — utility to convert non-2xx responses into `HttpStatusException`
- `BoundaryFailureClassifier` support for `HttpStatusException`: classifies 429 and 5xx as transient, other 4xx as permanent, with `Retry-After` propagation

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-15

Initial release of Outcome — a framework for building action plans based on
natural language inputs.

### Added
- `Outcome` type with success/failure semantics and tracking keys
- `Boundary` for structured failure classification with transient/permanent/correctable types
- Retry support via `Retrier` with configurable strategies and corrective retry
- Operator reporting: `Log4jOpReporter`, `MetricsOpReporter`, `SlackOpReporter`, `TeamsOpReporter`
- `CompositeReporter` for combining multiple reporters
- `DefectClassifier` for mapping exceptions to failure types
- Static convenience methods for low-ceremony usage
